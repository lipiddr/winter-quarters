		<h1>What is the difference between a Township and a Settlement</h1>
                  <p>A <b>township</b> is a geographic land division within a county. (Exampe: Boomer Township is in Pottawattamie County, Iowa.) Prior to 1853, Pottawattamie County was only divided into election precincts and had no distinctive township organization or administration (<em>Frontier Chronicle</em>, Pottawattamie County Genealogical Society). The official definition of a township is discussed on <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">www.wikipedia.org</a>: &quot;The term township generally means the district or area associated with a town. However in some systems, especially in the U. S., no town need be involved. . . . Specific use of the term . . . usually [describes] a local rural or sem-rural government within a county.&quot;</p>

<p>A <b>settlement</b> is a specific town within a county, often within a township. (Example: Kanesville is a settlement within Kane Township in Pottawattamie County, Iowa.)<br />

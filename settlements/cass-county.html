<p>This clipping from the <em>Council Bluffs Bugle</em> of January 2, 1855, stated the following:</p>

<p>THE BEAUTIFUL VILLAGE OF IRANISTAN,</p>

<p>Situated forty-five miles East of Council Bluff City [Kanesville], on either side of Indian Creek, in the middle of the best farming country in the State of Iowa: offers</p>

<p>RARE INDUCEMENTS</p>

<p>to mechanics, and others, seeking a good heal thy location in the great West. It boasts the best mill seat in Western Iowa, upon which is erected a good substantial stone dam, one saw and grist mill, together with other machinery, are now in successful operation.</p>

<p>THE GREAT AIR LINE RAIL ROAD,</p>

<p>now being constructed from New York and Philadelphia, via: Fort Wayne to Council Bluff City, passes within a few rods of the village aforesaid, and a line of stages, from Keokuk to Council Bluff City, arrive and depart daily from this place. Some fifty to seventy-five thousand emigrants pass through Iranistan annually, on their way to California, Utah and Oregon, making ready sale for all kinds of produce, and furnishing employment, at good prices, for various kinds of mechanics.</p>

<p>Eligible locations may be had in the village at reasonable prices.</p>

<p>Further information may be had by application to S.T. CARY, Proprietor, Iranistan, Cass County, Iowa. (1)</p>

<p>&quot;This, the pioneer village of Cass county, was located on the northeast quarter of the southwest quarter of section 8, about two miles west of the present site of the town of Lewis. From the time of its birth until the location of the future county seat it was the principal trading point for all the settlers in the neighborhood. This village and <a href="#Indiantown"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indiantown</span></a> were but a mile and a quarter apart, and there was considerable rivalry between them, but Iranistan, having been started first, held its own. F. E. Ball was the original owner of the site, but sold it to Stephen T. Carey, for $500. Carey laid out the town in the winter of 1852-3, and the plat was filed for record on the 1st of March, 1854. Carey was a resident of Council Bluffs, but when at Iranistan he boarded at the house of Nelson T. Spoor.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1854 Nelson T. Spoor bought an interest in the town site and the mill, but Mr. Carey dying the same year, the property passed into the hands of W. N. Dickerson, a man by the name of Jones and others.</p>

<p>&quot;The construction of the saw mill was commenced in 1852, by F. E. Ball, but he shortly after sold it, with the town site, to S. T. Carey, who completed it in the spring of 1853. This was the first mill of any kind in the county, and was of great service in furnishing the settlers with what lumber they required.</p>

<p>&quot;The first building erected in the town after the saw mill was commenced, was W. C. Croft&#39;s house, a temporary structure. He kept boarders, among whom were the Buckwalters.&quot; (2)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The town of Iranistan also acquired a post office in 1854. Though doomed, the town showed considerable resilience. Its post office didn&#39;t close until April of 1857.&rdquo; (3)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the central part of section 8, Cass Township, about two miles west of the present town of Lewis.&rdquo; (4)</p>

<p><strong>Cold Springs.</strong> The name of the post office at the town of Iranistan from 1851 to 1855. (5)</p>

<p>Indiantown is thought of as the first village in the county, but such is not the case. Iranistan is the pioneer town as it was laid out in 1852 by Stephen Carey on a tract he had purchased for $300.00 from F. E. Ball. Indiantown was not laid out until the summer of 1853 by W. N. Dickerson who had purchased the site from V. M. Conrad. However, Indiantown was known far and wide, while its most important rival, Iranistan, had but local celebrity. . . . Iranistan was the center of social life prior to the founding of Lewis and gambling, horse racing and other sports furnished entertainment for the many who gathered there every Saturday to do their trading. Mr. Ball started a saw mill there in 1852 and after purchasing the townsite, Carey completed the mill, the first in the county. It performed an important service in furnishing settlers with lumber for their new homes. The next structure erected in Iranistan in 1853 was the W. C. Croft boarding house. It was soon followed by the George Shannon blacksmithy, the Peter Hedges hotel and the Leander McCarty dwelling and store. Other merchants in the new town were Jeremiah Bradshaw and Jobe Haworth. Eber and William Buckwalter operated a hotel and livery service and for two years a saloon was operated by O. O. Turner. Dr. John Welch was the first physician at Iranistan. A man named Taylor was the first school teacher, but his service to the community ended tragically when he was drowned while bathing in the Nishnabotna river in June 1853.</p>

<p>In 1920 the state society of the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a marker on the site of the once flourishing village of Iranistan. (7)</p>

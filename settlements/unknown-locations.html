		<h1>Unknown Locations</h1>

<h2>McClelland&#39;s Camp</h2>

<p>It was also known as McClellin&rsquo;s Camp. The location of McLelland&rsquo;s Camp is unknown. It was an LDS branch for a short while (1).</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>David Norton was listed as a high priest in the 1848 High Priest Census (2).</p>

<p>&ldquo;No McClellin appears in the 1850 and 1852 censuses, so it may have only existed during the early period&rdquo; (3).</p>

<h3>Marriages</h3>

<p>John and Grace Muir were married on January 27, 1849 by Orson Hyde (4). They lived in McClelland&rsquo;s Camp for about a year. Their son was born and blessed by James McClelland, president of the branch, in December of 1849. In the following spring of 1850, they moved from McClelland&rsquo;s Camp to Lake Branch (5).</p>

It was a marriage of convenience so she could cross the plains and care for his children. When they arrived in Utah he told her she was free but she chose to remain in polygamy. She died at the birth of a son 11 February 1849&hellip; The Alexanders settled in the Heber Valley in Utah&rdquo; (8).</p>

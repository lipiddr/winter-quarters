                  <p>The Winter Quarters Project is an ongoing effort to identify and publish information about members of the LDS Church who lived in the Winter Quarters, Nebraska, and Middle Missouri areas between the years 1846 and 1853. Thousands of Mormon pioneers were migrating west after their exodus from Nauvoo and Hancock County in 1846. They resided in a temporary encampment west of the Missouri River known as Winter Quarters, located in present-day Florence, Nebraska. After 1847, many moved east across the Missouri and and resided in some ninety plus settlements in western Iowa. Many individuals are buried in the area, most without headstones or grave markers. The goal of the Winter Quarters Project is to identify settlements and write the histories of those settlements. Included in the history are possible locations of associated cemeteries and as many of these early pioneers as possible.</p>
                  <p>This website is funded and maintained by students and faculty in the College of Life Sciences. The Winter Quarters Project is an independent research venture. New genealogical and historical information is added to this website as it is discovered. This website identifies:</p>

<p>At the end of the sexton&#39;s list of Winter Quarters burials is a list of people buried at <a href="/maps/cutlers-park-map.html">Cutler&#39;s Park</a>, a settlement near <a href="/settlements/nebraska.html#WinterQuarters">Winter Quarters</a>. The number of the grave was listed on the sexton&#39;s record.&nbsp; There were several deaths that occurred before the records were kept.&nbsp; Those possible burials have been added, indicated by x1 through x7.&nbsp; The exact location of these Cutler&#39;s Park burials were previously not known. Some records indicate that the Saints buried at Cutler&#39;s Park were later moved to a different location which is also unknown.<br />
<br />
In the Fall of 2015, a ground penetrating radar survey was performed at the top of the hill where it was presumed that the Cutler&#39;s Park settlement was located.&nbsp; The survey found the location of 69 possible grave sites.&nbsp;</p>

		<h1>Statistics of the Winter Quarters Ninth Ward</h1>
					<p>All family members of the head of the household living within the Ward boundaries are listed prior to their departure West or through 1853, occurred first. Some of these children may have been married or died and were not living with the family when the Ward census was taken. The Winter Quarters wards were only in place from 1846-1848, at which time the government required the Latter-day Saints, who were on Indian lands, to move back to the east side of the Missouri River.</p>

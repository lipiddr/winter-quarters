<blockquote><p>1.  George traveled West in the James Lake Company (1850) with his wife (Clark, Susannah), and parents (Clark, Richard and Clark, Ann Elizabeth).</p>
<p>2. "...In 1842, at Indianapolis, he heard the Gospel for the first time, an Elder having visited that place, and Bro. Clark became convinced at once.  In the spring of 1843 he was baptised in the Mississippi River at Nauvoo.  Returning to Indiana he succeeded in selling his farm worth $2,000 for a tenth of that sum and after varied experiences he returned to NAuvoo, hwere he was made a city guard.  Geroge was ordained a member of the 13th quorum of SEventy by George A. Smith and others.  In 1846, George crossed the Mississippi river with the body of the Saints headed for the western wilds.  When at the Missouri river the call was made for troops to go to Mexico in the service of the United STates, he became one fo the noted Mormon Battalion, serving in Company B; but at the line he was put on the sick list and returned to Pueblo.  In the Spring of 1847 he and the others of the sick detachment again started for the mountains, overtaking the pioneers at Green river and arrived there with them.  He was one of the company that returned to Winter Quarters soon after reaching Salt Lake Valley."    <br>

<h2 align=center>Notes</h2>
<hr>
<p><a href="pafg04.htm#93" name="93"><b>Ann Davis</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>1.  Because Ann was living with her son James and daughter-in-law Emma in 1850, it is likely that she traveled West with them (arriving sometime before 12 Nov 1852).</p>

<blockquote><p>1. buried in Key Hill Cemetery.  Maybe England?</blockquote>

<p><a href="pafg04.htm#111" name="111"><b>Charles Edward Dalley</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>1. Unable to find him on the 1850 U.S. Federal Census.  Perhaps the Edward in the 1850 Census of Pottawattamie in household dwelling #428 (With Ann Dalley, James & Emma Dalley) is this Edward and the census taker forgot to put the other number next to the "2" for his age (i.e. 2__ = 23 or 24 yrs.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>1.  Parmelia Greenleaf Holman traveled to Utah sometime before her marriage to Vinedge (Virge/Virage) Garrigus (Garogis/Garage) in Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah on 29 Jun 1851.  She probably traveled with her family in the 1850 James Lake Company.</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="pafg04.htm#110" name="110"><b>William H. Dalley</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>1. William appears in the 1860 U.S. Federal Census in Cedar City, Iron, Utah.  He probably came West with his family before 16 Jun 1852 when his child, William, was born in Pleasant Grove, Utah, Utah (Ancestry.com).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="pafg04.htm#116" name="116"><b>Mandana Hillman</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>1. Mandana appears in the 1860 U.S. Federal Census in Cedar City, Iron, Utah.  She probably came West with her family before 16 Jun 1852 when her child, William was born in Pleasant Grove (Ancestry.com).</p>

<hr>
<p><a href="pafg04.htm#117" name="117"><b>Sarah Ann Dalley</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>1.  Probably went West with her parents before Jun 1852 for the birth of her brother, William, on the 16th.  She appears in the 1860 U.S. Federal Census in Cedar City, Iron, Utah with her parents.</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="pafg04.htm#123" name="123"><b>Moroni Dalley</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>1. Probably went West with his family before Jun 1852 for the birth of his brother, William, on the 16th.  He appears with his family in the 1860 U.S. Federal Census in Cedar City, Iron, Utah.</blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a href="pafg04.htm#125" name="125"><b>Edward Dalley</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>1.  Unsure of relation Edward has with James, Emma, and Ann Dally.  The 1850 census makes it seem that Edward is their son, but James and Emma weren't married until 1850...<p>2.   Edward does not appear on the 1860 Census with Emma and James in Utah.<p>3.   Perhaps this Edward is actually the son of Ann Davis and William Dalley and the Census-taker forgot to put the other number next to the "2" for Edward's age (i.e. 2__ = 23 or 24 yrs.)</blockquote>

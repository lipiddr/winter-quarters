<blockquote><p>There is some confusion concerning his birthdate.  The census shows he was born in Iowa in 1852 and the date of the year agrees.  The month and day are unclear because he must have been born before traveling West.  He does not appear on the Pioneer Overland Travel but if he was born in Iowa I feel confident making this conclusion.  Also on the Pioneer Overland Travel they have record of two sons for Cynthia and Caleb, but one is written as John, who wasn't born until 1860.  I wonder if this was infact Lorenzo.</blockquote>

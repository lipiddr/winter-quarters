<blockquote><p>Served as a Bishop in Kirtland</p>
<p>In 1835, a meeting was called for the purpose of blessing those who had distinguished themselves in their work for the Kirtland Temple and this included Thomas Burdick who was later appointed as a clerk or scribe and still later became a missionary in New York state.</p>
<p>Judge Thomas Burdick led a company of over 100 wagons from Kanesville to Salt Lake City.  They departed 9-18 May 1853 and arrived in Salt Lake on 19 June 1853.  Except for the Burdick family, the remainder of the company were non-Mormons.  After arriving in Salt Lake, most of the company (including the Burdicks) continued on to Los Angeles.

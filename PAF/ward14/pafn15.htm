<blockquote><p>The family came West with the Jedediah M. Grant/Joseph B. Noble Company in 1847.  The son, William Dorris was serving in Company D of the Mormon Battalion.  He joined when he was 16 years old.  On the 1850 U. S. Census, the family is listed as James age 42, Drusilla age 40, Rebecca age 15, Joseph S. age 13, Rebecca age 8, William age 6, John M age 4, Samuel A. age 2, Alvira Smith age 19, Henrietta Whitney age 29.  Next door is William Dr. Hendricks age 21 and Mary J. ae 17.</p>
<p>On the Winter Quarters 14th Ward Records, a notation is made saying "Son in Army, himself a cijner."  It should say "himself a cripple."  At the Battle of Crooked Rive, he was shot down by the mob.  He never recovered from the effects and remained a cripple the rest of his life.</p>

<blockquote><p>From Jeremiah Willey's autobiography:  "About this time (1834) a man by the name of Aspenall, who had lost his wife, said that inasmuch as you have no children, I have a little girl about one year old which I will give you.  My wife went to his house and brought the child home.  While I was in this place, I bought a farm in the town of Salisbury, New Hampshire.  On this farm lived my wife's sister who had received the gospel.  She took this little girl home with her.  We had named her Abigail."</p>

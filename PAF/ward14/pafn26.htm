<blockquote><p>July 1841 (History of the Church, p. 389)<br>
Brother William Yocum had his leg amputated by Dr. John F. Weld, who operated free of charge; he was wounded at Haun's Mill, October 30th, 1838 and had lain on his back ever since; and now it was found the only chance to save his life was to have his leg cut off.  He was also shoot through the head at the same massacre.</p>

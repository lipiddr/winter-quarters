</blockquote>

<p><a href="pafg02.htm#34" name="34"><b>Nancy Mason Lazell</b></a></p>

<p><a href="pafg02.htm#53" name="53"><b>Elizabeth Allred</b></a></p>

<hr>
<p><a href="pafg02.htm#54" name="54"><b>Salley Allred</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Marshall and Bedford county are adjacent to one another so the city of Farmington could have been in either or during the time of this child and other children's births in this family, but there are more sources for the Marshall County.<br>
Died before family came to Iowa.<br>
Monroe is both a city and a county in Missouri, so she could have died in just the county or the actual city Monroe..</blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a href="pafg02.htm#68" name="68"><b>Elizabeth Heskett Allred</b></a></p>

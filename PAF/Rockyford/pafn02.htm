<blockquote><p>Abraham Coon is listed as the father to Eli, Jacob, John, and Joseph Coon in the Iowa Branch Member Index but none of the records indicate this relation.  Abraham Coon and his wives were also listed in the Mill Branch 1847 in the Iowa Branch Member Index.  Because of this incongruity I have listed them in this branch and will list them in the Mill Branch 1847.</p>

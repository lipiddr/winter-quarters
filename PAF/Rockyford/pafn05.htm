<blockquote><p>Most likely died before 1852 becasue he didn't come across the plains with his family in 1852.</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel records say she died on the trek but the Census says that she made it to Utah and was 1 year old.  I don't know which record is right.</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Different sources point to two general different years and places for her death: 1841 in Nauvoo or 1897 in Escalante, Utah.  <br>
However, a Biah Porter is present in the 1850 Census with a Jerrie or Jerric Porter.  This is likely to be the same Abiah Franklin Porter, therefore it is more likely that she did not die in Nauvoo, but in Utah.  Also, in a history of Nathan Staker (brother of Jared Porter's second wife), mentions that Porter married Cornelia Staker "in polygamy," indicating that he was currently married (and it appears it would have been Abiah Franklin at that point).</p>

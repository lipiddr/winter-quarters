<h2 align=center>Notes</h2>

<p><a href="pafg01.htm#7" name="7"><b>Samuel Bradford Cutler</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Samuel Married Sarah Anna who was born in Amboy, Oswego, New York in the year 1834 (about).</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="pafg01.htm#12" name="12"><b>Harmon Cutler Jr.</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>He was a member of the Nauvoo 3rd Ward. There are many records in the newspaper of Harmon Cutler and real estate transfers and advertisements, but there are multiple Harmon Cutlers.</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="pafg01.htm#13" name="13"><b>Zachariah Cutler</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Almost every document I found said that he was born in a different place than the other, so I just put down Springville since we know that his family lived in Springville at the time of his birth.</blockquote>

<p><a href="pafg01.htm#15" name="15"><b>Samuel Williams</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>In 1850 Samuel had a household of five, with a real wealth of$75 and no personal wealth. Comments: #21. Samuel was a member of the Nauvoo, Illinois 2nd ward. Comments: #31. Samuel was a temporary member of the Nauvoo high council. Comments: #41. Samuel was a member of the elders quorum presidency. </p>
<p>He was married to Ruth Bishop on Mar 5, 1810 and then she died in 1846, and I'm assuming that's before they even got to Springville because she was burried in Nauvoo. On Apr 3, 1847 Samuel married Rebecca Pierce (Pearis Raymond's wife) because Pearis also died in 1846. On Jun 1, 1851 he married Henrietta Nelson. Sometime after that he married Jemima Nelson. He only had children with Ruth.</p>

<p><a href="pafg01.htm#35" name="35"><b>Nelson Whipple Tiffany</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>There is some discrepancy on where Nelson was born.  All three sources indicate a different place whether it was Wyoming, Nebraska, or Utah.  I think that it is safe to say that he was born while crossing the plains and it couldn't have been in 1853 because the rest of his family were already in Utah by 1852.  I have chosen Fort Laramie because I feel it most properly takes into account the time when the Tiffany family came over to Utah and it takes into consideration how long he had been in Utah judging from the Census of 1860.</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Gerua was sick during the summer of 1848 with dropsy and canker. She died in Sept. Burried in the graveyard on the hill at a point of timber near his house (head of the hollow on the prairie)." - Nelson W. W.</blockquote>

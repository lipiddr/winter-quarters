<blockquote><p>Married Joseph Meacham, and interestingly enough, in the 1850 census, she is not listed with her mother and siblings, but with the Meacham family.  Her last name is still Tuttle on the census, though, corresponding with their date of marriage (5 Jan 1853) and the branch record of Harris Grove, which lists her as a Tuttle with her mother and siblings.  Oddly, Joseph Meacham and his family are not found on the Harris Grove Branch list, but they are listed with the other Harris Grove residents on the 1850 Census.  I conclude that Sarah was perhaps already being courted by Joseph, or perhaps helped out the family, and later she and Joseph fell in love and were wed.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>These pages include information about residents of the Winter Quarters 3rd Ward area. The 23 Winter Quarters
            wards were only in existence from 1846-1848, however we have included here all of the information about the
            families of the ward residents up until 1853. Please note that not all of the people listed here resided at
            Winter Quarters.

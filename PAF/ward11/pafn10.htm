<p><a href="pafg10.htm#229" name="229"><b>James Craig</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Known as the "Bugler of Pioneers." He was a member of a company called to assist in exterminating reptiles, birds, and dangerous animals. In 1845 he was called on a mission for a time as president of the Preston, England Conference. Later he labored in Ireland. He was called to establish settlements in southern Utah.</p>
<p>LDS Member Name Index, 1830-45 database from Ancestry.com states he died in Santa Clara in 1868 "-- Incident," possibly indicating that was the cause of death. No other information was found concerning the cause of death and whether wife Margaret and children Daniel and Margaret Ann were involved, but it seems plausible.</p>

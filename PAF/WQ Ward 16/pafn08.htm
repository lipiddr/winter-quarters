<blockquote><p>Azariah traveled back to the Salt Lake Vally in the Jonathan H. Holmes/Samuel Thompson Company (1848)<br>
 <br>
Departure: 2 July 1848<br>
Arrival: 6 September 1848</p>
<p>Company Information:<br>
This company consisted of 44 men and 1 woman, 39 of whom were returning Mormon Battalion veterans. In early May a small survey group set out from Sutter's Fort to find a trail across the Sierra Mountains that could be traversed by wagons. This company constructed a wagon road over Carson Pass which was later used by many traveling to and from California. They left Pleasant Valley (near Placerville) and crossed the Sierras to Carson Valley. At that point the company divided into smaller groups and traveled to Salt Lake City. .  After their discharge in 1847, they, with others, traveled north to Sutter's Fort and then turned east toward Great SAlt Lake Valley.  They learned that food was scarce in the Valley and it was considered wise for a number of men to return to California.  Azariah, with one horse and scant provisions, left his father and went back to Sutter's Fort where he hired out to build a sawmill.  While he was there gold was discovered.</p>

This company consisted of 44 men and 1 woman, 39 of whom were returning Mormon Battalion veterans. In early May a small survey group set out from Sutter's Fort to find a trail across the Sierra Mountains that could be traversed by wagons. This company constructed a wagon road over Carson Pass which was later used by many traveling to and from California. They left Pleasant Valley (near Placerville) and crossed the Sierras to Carson Valley. At that point the company divided into smaller groups and traveled to Salt Lake City. </p>

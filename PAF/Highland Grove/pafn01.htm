<h2 align=center>Notes</h2>

<p><a href="pafg01.htm#7" name="7"><b>Aaron George Sperry</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Most likely died where his father did in WInter Quarters, Nebraska or Council Bluffs, Iowa.</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="pafg01.htm#20" name="20"><b>Mary MANTLE</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Her Burial place is most likely incorrect becuase her birth place is England adn she died that very year in between the fall and December. Plus the History of the Family has them leaving from an England port in October of 1842.</blockquote>

<p><a href="pafg01.htm#17" name="17"><b>Catherine Ann MANTLE</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>English Grove is possibly a town in Atchison County, Missouri which would make some sense because her Brother Llewellyn was born in Missouri. Other English Grove's are in Minnesota and Pennsylvania which neither of them make sense because Pennsylvania is backtracking from their trek to Utah and Minnesota is also out of the way of their destination.</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Her younger sister, Anne, was born in England just after she died.</blockquote>

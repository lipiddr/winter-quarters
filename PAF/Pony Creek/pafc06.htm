"On our arrival on the Missouri river we were counseled to locate for the winter on Poney Creek, down the river about 30 miles, but on our arrival there we found the place very unhealthy and thus unfit for habitation.  My mother (Basmath Hutchins Whipple) died September 9, 1846. She was born September 7, 1769, in Massachusetts. A few days later (September 13, 1846) my wife died. She was born July 7, 1811, in Dummerston, Vermont. Of the whole camp consisting of 14 families all but two persons were sick, and while we were there we buried some whole families. We finally moved to another place, about 4 miles distant. My littel girl ( Mariah Blanch), when twenty-two months old, died at our new location, December 8, 1846, and her remains were taken to the place where her mother was buried. She was born February 15, 1845; her remains were placed in a coffin made of split plank (bugswood tree).".</p>

<blockquote><p>Sarah moved to Hagerman, Idaho and lived her life out there.  I tried to look up more information on her move and I found that she married Henry Secor, but that is all I could uncover thus far.<br>

<blockquote><p>When comparing the two records I find that the Geneological record of the Condit's is more reliable than the Ancestral file but both are fairly close in dates.  But there is a descrepancy between the birth year concerning Frederick.</blockquote>

"These lists are taken from a variety of historical sources.  They are not complete, and because of the difficulty reading handwriting, may not be entirely accurate.  Most of the lists seem to be from the winter of 1846-47, but some are from later.  In addition, people often moved to better housing, thus changing wards.<br>
Sources for these lists are : bishop's reports, high council meeting minutes, tithing records, and 'census' reports of widows, soldier's wives and other unassigned members of wards.<br>
The original records are available at the Historical Department, Archives Division, of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, Utah.".<br>
